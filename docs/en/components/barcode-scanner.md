# component barcode-scanner
-productive work based on the project "https://ionic.io/blog/how-to-build-an-ionic-barcode-scanner-with-capacitor"
*When performing work, errors occurred when working in Android Studio
To solve these issues, I used the article "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63267827/capacitor-settings-gradle-as-it-does-not-exist" These commands are executed in VSCodium
*In AndroidManifest.xml you need to add a permission command to launch the camera "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />"
