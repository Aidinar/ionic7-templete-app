> This component is designed to pass the terms of use in an Angular application
> The development of this component uses the Angular HTTP client to request and receive RSS feed data. The component includes key HTML elements and Angular directives for interacting and visualizing feed elements. These include:
- <ng-container> is used as a logical container that can contain dynamic templates.
- *ngFor - structural directive for rendering a list of elements received from the RSS feed.
- <div> represents a container for each RSS feed element.
- async pipe is used to work with an observable, returned HTTP request.
- rssUrl is a string variable containing the URL of the RSS feed, which must be defined and correctly set to the address of the hosted feed.
